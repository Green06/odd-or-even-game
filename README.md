# odd-or-even-game
This is a similar game like stone , paper, sicissors.We used to play this game when i am in school. Two people is playing the game. one will take odd option and the other will be even. Then they start to play with their hands,showing some signs which will denote the numbers from 0 to 10. when we add both the numbers, if we get an even number the person who choose even will win otherwise the other one will win the game.

This is a simple project made with python.Here we are playing with our machine!!
